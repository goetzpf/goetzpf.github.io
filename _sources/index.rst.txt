   :caption: Contents:

This is a list of open source projects mostly related to my work at the
`Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin <https://www.helmholtz-berlin.de>`_.

For some projects, I am the only developer, for others I have made
contributions.

A third category of projects have no contributions by me but are republished
here since they are very old and hard to find anywhere else.

All projects are have some kind of open source license, the copyright
holder is described in the project.

Databases
=========

Projects that act as a database.

- `YAML-StructuredData <https://yaml-structureddata.sourceforge.io/>`_ [#HZB]_:
  Software to manage, organize, storing and type-check your data
  in the `YAML <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML>`_ format.

Software development
====================

These are tools that in general help software development:

- `git-gq <https://goetzpf.github.io/git-gq/>`_: A patch queue implementation
  for git. This is inspired by mercurial (mq) patch queues.
- `hg-diff <https://hg-diff.sourceforge.net/>`_: hg-diff is a program to browse
  and compare mercurial revisions.
- `hgstat <https://github.com/goetzpf/hgstat>`_: A shell script to display the
  overall state of a mercurial repository.

  processor with python syntax
- `rsync-dist <https://rsync-dist.sourceforge.io/>`_ [#HZB]_: This manages

  old versions are kept and active versions are selected with symbolic links.

Field Bus I/O
=============

- `socan <https://socan.sourceforge.io/>`_ [#HZB]_: socan is a high level library for
  using the `CAN Bus <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus>`_
  with `Linux <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux>`_.
  It also enables
  `MultiCAN <https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcan/>`_ to be used on
  `Linux <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux>`_ systems.

EPICS Projects
==============

`EPICS <https://epics-controls.org/>`_
is a set of software tools and applications which provide a software
infrastructure for use in building distributed control systems to operate
devices such as Particle Accelerators, Large Experiments and major Telescopes.

The following list shows projects that are used for EPICS:

- `DM2K <https://github.com/goetzpf/DM2K-HZB>`_ [#HZB_C]_: A display manager
  for `EPICS <https://epics-controls.org/>`_. Note that this is legacy code. It
  is not recommended that you use this display manager for new developments.
- `EDM <https://github.com/goetzpf/edm/tree/HZB>`_: A display manager
  for `EPICS <https://epics-controls.org/>`_. Check out with
  ``git clone -b HZB https://github.com/goetzpf/edm.git``,
  then follow instructions in file "README.install" under heading "HZB branch".
- `Pezca <https://pezca.sourceforge.io/>`_ [#HZB]_: A
  `Perl <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl>`_ interface to
  `channel access <https://docs.epics-controls.org/en/latest/internal/ca_protocol.html>`_,
  the `EPICS <https://epics-controls.org/>`_ network protocol.
- `epics-configure-iptables <https://github.com/goetzpf/epics-configure-iptables/>`_ [#HZB]_:
  A script that configures iptables to convert UDP broadcasts to a given port to UDP unicasts. This solves the problem with UDP unicasts when you run several channel access
  servers on a single host.
- `sumo <https://epics-sumo.sourceforge.io/>`_ [#HZB]_: The support module manager sumo
  is a program to build consistent sets of EPICS support modules and use them
  in EPICS applications.
- `udp-broadcaster <https://github.com/goetzpf/udp-broadcaster>`_ [#HZB]_: This program
  receives udp broadcast packets on one interface and port and
  forwards these to one or more other interfaces. It is used at the
  `Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin <https://www.helmholtz-berlin.de>`_ to forward
  `EPICS <https://epics-controls.org/>`_  name resolution requests to other networks
  for the channel access gateway infrastructure.

RTEMS support
=============

The operating systems `RTEMS <https://www.rtems.org/>`_ is an open
source real time operating system.

At the
`Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin <https://www.helmholtz-berlin.de>`__
`RTEMS <https://www.rtems.org/>`_ is used on
`VME Bus <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMEbus>`_ systems in the
control system.

The following list shows projects that help with RTEMS software development:

- `rtems-from-scratch <https://rtems-from-scratch.sourceforge.io/>`_ [#HZB]_: This
  helps to build the RTEMS cross compiler and other development tools.
  Very old RTEMS versions like version 4.9 are abandoned on the RTEMS project
  and the cross development tools can no longer be built directly. This project
  allows to create the cross development tools for RTEMS 4.9, 4.10, 4.11 and
  5.1.

  to build a RTEMS boot image for
  `VME Bus <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMEbus>`_ CPUs at the
  `Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin <https://www.helmholtz-berlin.de>`__.
  For RTEMS 4.9 it also compiles cexp and GeSys in the boot image which implement
  an interactive shell and support for dynamic loading of modules.
